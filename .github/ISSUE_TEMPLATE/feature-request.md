**Describe the content or mechanics you are proposing.**

Ai Learning/Teaching. (add a button that tells units when to record and play movement)
once you recruit units to follow you (like flares, daggers, and such) they copy your moves right? (direction, attack, item grabbing) so why not implement a feature that tells them to do and repeat? that can be helpful for people who dont want to just use units for fighting and instead use them for special purposes without learning the logic system, which can help alot because me and quite a bunch of people tend to struggle to make a proper logic display or even do a simple delivery system, so adding a learning/teaching mechanism for certain units can be helpful  espeicially if your playing single player and need some resource delivering help instead of defense.


**Describe how you think this content will improve the game. If you're proposing new content, mention how it may add more gameplay options or how it will fill a new niche.**

• Ai Learning/teaching can be useful for single player users when they need a helping hand but dont have other players to invite
• Ai Learning/teaching can be very accessible for people who dont know how to use the logic system properly
• Ai Learning/teaching can be useful for covering a huge area without spending alot of time
